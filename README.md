### Abstract
In this work we propose $`\mathbb{C}`$KAN, a complex-valued KAN, to join the intrinsic interpretability of KANs and the advantages of Complex-Valued Neural Networks (CVNNs). We show how to transfer a KAN and the necessary associated mechanisms into the complex domain. To confirm that $`\mathbb{C}`$KAN meets expectations we conduct experiments on symbolic complex-valued function fitting and physically meaningful formulae as well as on a more realistic dataset from knot theory. Our proposed $`\mathbb{C}`$KAN is more stable and performs on par or better than real-valued KANs while requiring less parameters and a shallower network architecture, making it more explainable.
